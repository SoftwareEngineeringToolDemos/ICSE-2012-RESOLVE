    <h3>General Information</h3>
    <p>
        This web-based environment is made up is of two parts--the upper menu bar
        along the top and the content tabs below. The leftmost item in the menu bar
        is the name of the currently selected project; any additional projects available
        may be seen by hovering the mouse over the currently selected name. Clicking
        another project name will load that project's components into the environment.
        The Environment item at the right of the menu bar contains controls for manipulating
        the environment. The environment allows users to create new components for 
        any of the available projects, which are persistently stored locally within
        the web browser itself. Navigating away, restarting the browser, or rebooting
        the computer does not destroy these components; upon reopening the environment
        any user-created components will be reloaded and available through the
        appropriate project. Clicking Export (under Environment) will export the 
        current state of the environment (including all user-created components)
        as an XML file, which can be downloaded and saved. This XML file can then
        be saved for backup purposes or imported back into the environment via the
        Import option. This import functionality can also be accessed using the 
        floppy disk icon on the menu bar. Simply dragging and dropping the exported
        XML file onto the icon will load it into the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lower portion of the environment is primarily used to display RESOLVE
        components through an intuitive, tab-based user interface. In contrast to
        typical IDE's, this environment presents components based on their relationships,
        not simply on their file system locations. (For more information on RESOLVE
        component relationships in the environment see
        <a href="http://www.cs.clemson.edu/group/resolve/research/reports/RSRG-11-03.pdf"
            target="_blank">
            Technical Report RSRG-11-03</a>.)
        There are five tabs available, each representing a type of component--facility,
        concept, concept realization, enhancement, or enhancement realization.
        To begin, only the facility and concept tabs are active, as indicated by the
        blue arrow on the tab. Clicking the arrow opens a dropdown menu containing
        any available components of that type. Selecting a component name opens
        it in the built-in RESOLVE editor, providing keyword highlighting and
        syntax error checking. Buttons to the right provide access to any available
        component-specific functionality.

<h2>RESOLVE Verifying Compiler</h2>
<div style="text-align:left">
    <h3>General Information</h3>
    <p>
        The foundations underlying the RESOLVE Verifying Compiler are both sound
        and relatively complete.  The current, working implementation is sound
        (as far as we know, but not proved), but incomplete.   This means that
        some correct programs will not pass automated verification.  However,
        the generated verification conditions should be provable.
